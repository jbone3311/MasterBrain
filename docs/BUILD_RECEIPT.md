# Build and validation receipt

Updated 2026-09-20 Pacific. Product: `jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain`, verified **private**.

## Parallel implementation and pressure-test pass

Code/test commit: `3b7d972` (integrated implementation `c9e1829`).
[GitHub Actions run 35555204407](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35555204407)
completed successfully:

- **485 Python tests passed**, including 52 real PostgreSQL integration cases;
  no CI database skips. Six additional Node UI-contract tests passed.
- Strict typing passed across 24 source modules; lint, document/link gates,
  developer container build and CLI smoke passed.
- Locally: 433 Python tests passed; 52 database cases explicitly skipped; six
  Node tests passed. Full Git-history secret scan found no leaks through this commit.
- Four agents total worked on implementation and independent adversarial review.
  Changes were integrated and checked together, not counted as isolated successes.

Shipped in this increment: certified inventory reconciliation and expired-history
recovery; exact-byte bounded MIME quarantine; resumable fictional-inbox seeding;
owner import-health and paginated held-message metadata; Gmail/Graph read-only
libraries and an injected-session IMAP contract. Only Fastmail currently has durable
database worker orchestration. New provider libraries are not enrolled live connectors.

The fake-mailbox lifecycle imports 256 varied messages, applies seven changed IDs,
then recovers twenty unseen deletions after expired history. Parser checks include
1,000 seeded bounded random byte inputs. These are not a multi-day soak or measured
production throughput benchmark. [Coverage and gaps](TEST_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md).

Independent review found and verified fixes for decoder-produced NUL/surrogate
strings reaching SQL, inconsistent demo-account guards including a preflight race,
Gmail quota 403 misclassification, Graph non-ASCII Retry-After values and empty-body
deadline bypass. Integration review also corrected real provider/library contract
assumptions: Gmail minimal responses need not contain timestamps/history/thread,
and IMAPClient may consume the inner UID into its response dictionary key.

A temporary loopback UI with a mocked Store was checked in the actual browser:
connect, fictional search, evidence inspection, held-message status, and session
clearing all worked. The temporary server and tab were closed. This was not a live
database/browser integration run or full accessibility acceptance; CI separately
exercises real PostgreSQL and the HTTP API.

Remaining warnings are upstream test-client deprecations and GitHub runner/action
upgrade notices. Production OIDC, cloud infrastructure, restore drills, larger
encrypted objects, binary extraction, durable additional-provider workers, actual
model inference/MCP, action execution and Factory binding remain release gates.
No real mailbox, model, paid cloud service or Factory runtime was activated.

Prior recovery-only pass: `9173e26`,
[CI 35553409905](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35553409905),
180 passing Python tests. The receipt above supersedes its test totals.

## Read-worker refinement pass

Code commit: `01eb47d`.
[GitHub Actions run 35501983332](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35501983332)
completed successfully:

- **119 tests passed**, including 29 real PostgreSQL integration cases; none skipped in CI.
- Strict typing passed across 20 source modules; lint and all document/link gates passed.
- Developer Docker image build and CLI smoke test passed.
- Full Git-history secret scan found no leaks through this code commit.
- Locally: 90 passed, 29 database tests explicitly skipped (no local Postgres).

Added durable listing/change checkpoints, leased single-account orchestration,
stale-worker/account-binding fencing, restart after query churn, retry deadlines,
failure pauses and content-free run receipts. Tests include eight simultaneous
lease contenders, process recreation, crash-after-commit replay, deleted messages
during listing, wrong-account tokens, provider failures, expired cursors and MIME
rollback. Retry bounds cover 15,015 combinations. This is bounded fault/pressure
testing, **not** a long-running soak, production load test or live-provider trial.

The first CI attempt caught PostgreSQL infinity timestamps that Python could not
decode in status rows; a forward migration replaced those sentinels. Review also
prevented an unsafe cursor-expiry reset: that path now explicitly pauses pending
the inventory-diff reconciler. [Worker limits and recovery](READ_WORKER.md).

Remaining warnings: two upstream Python test-client deprecations and CI action/
runner upgrade notices. They do not fail this run; dependency/runtime upgrades
remain in the supply-chain backlog. No additional mailbox/cloud privileges were added.

## Earlier foundation verification

Code commit: `3612ac5`.
[GitHub Actions run 35480784089](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35480784089)
completed successfully:

- **69 tests passed**, including 16 real PostgreSQL integration cases; none skipped in CI.
- Lint passed; strict typing passed across 18 source modules.
- Repository quality gate and all 16 document-pack/local-link checks passed.
- Developer Docker image built and its CLI smoke test passed.
- Local full-history secret scan found no leaks through the tested implementation commit.

The tests exercise actual PostgreSQL 17 using a non-owner runtime role, real HTTP
API-to-database flow, tenant isolation, transaction-local context reset, composite
ownership, concurrent replay, checkpoint rollback, proposal/evidence/review flow,
correlated audit, historical evidence and attachment search/accounting. Provider
network tests use mocked HTTP only. Two upstream test-client deprecation warnings
remain; they are not skipped/failed checks and should be resolved during dependency maintenance.

## What was not done

No real mailbox access, sending, deletion, folder modification, model inference,
paid cloud provisioning, production restore, malware scanning or Factory bind.
No Factory/other Product files were modified. Five portable improvement requests
are staged in this Product's `_FACTORY_CANDIDATES.jsonl`, not adopted upstream.

The working build remains in the Codex project workspace. Factory's actual source
checkout was located at `~/CW-Systems/CW-Factory`; its Dropbox counterpart
is the content surface. Canonical Email Brain local placement is parked in Q08,
so no existing source/content folders have been moved or reorganized. Runtime
databases and credentials must remain outside Dropbox regardless of source placement.

## Reproduce

See [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md). The ZIP is a source-only Git
archive: no `.git`, local venv, caches, credentials, database or real mail. It
contains the docs, implementation, synthetic tests, migrations and dependency lock.
CI evidence above names the exact code commit; subsequent documentation-only
receipt changes do not imply a separate live deployment.
