# MasterBrain Implementation Status

Updated 2026-09-21. **Implemented** means executable in this repository; it does not
mean hosted, live-source accepted, or production ready.

## Implemented

- Existing `email_brain` capability: Fastmail/JMAP read worker, raw/evidence storage,
  MIME/attachment accounting, PostgreSQL FTS, owner search/read, reviewed rules,
  recovery/quarantine, synthetic mailbox, PDF approval path, and narrow reviewed
  travel/bill memory. Existing detailed guides define exact limits.
- Offline-tested Gmail/Graph libraries and an injected-session IMAP contract.
- MasterBrain package boundary with DataCore read-only file hash, filter, duplicate
  grouping, name grouping and file comparison extracted from FOS-Master.
- Dedicated `masterbrain` CLI for shared hash/compare/duplicate commands and
  deterministic read-only FileOS snapshots; source files are never changed.
- Immutable source/item/version/evidence/provenance contracts with stable opaque IDs,
  safe relative locators, bounded metadata and explicit source-bound evidence.
- Synthetic DataCore unit corpus and live-donor parity harness pinned to FOS-Master
  commit `218d5caec2f20b9047fd3eb8e027dc671acf0c15`.
- Additive shared DataCore persistence, FileOS text/Markdown/HTML/CSV extraction,
  lexical index and progressive evidence/content/change Brain API.
- Source-bound FileOS PDF/DOCX/XLSX extraction contract and dedicated restricted
  worker image with archive/active-content bounds; hosted container and restore gates green.
- Explicit private-config FileOS snapshot publication command with exact worker scopes,
  idempotent replay and repeated authorization; hosted PostgreSQL acceptance pending.
- Reviewed KnowledgeCore entities, aliases, relationships, claims, events, projects,
  commitments and corrections with evidence links, temporal history, lexical search,
  exact reads, change feed, forced RLS and append-only enforcement.
- Grouped dual-scope search across DataCore evidence and KnowledgeCore assertions,
  with independent limits/ranks and evidence IDs for progressive drill-down.

## Designed, not implemented

- Scheduled/incremental FileOS scanning, durable whole-run receipts and legacy
  Office/archive/image/OCR extraction.
- Automatic KnowledgeCore extraction, known-answer quality evaluation, graph traversal,
  semantic ranking and Email/FOS knowledge migration.
- Unified cross-source synthesis and external LLM client integrations.
- Hosted operation and production identity/source enrollment.
- Any FileOS write, move, quarantine, dedupe deletion, cutover, fold or retirement.

## Verification boundaries

Most Email tests use synthetic data; PostgreSQL suites require an explicitly disposable
database and local skips do not count. The parity script requires a clean checkout of
the pinned FOS-Master commit. It compares normalized observable scan results and does
  now covers fixture and scale hash/name/both scans, pair comparisons and hashes. It
  does not cover donor CLI text, configuration discovery, logging or file effects.
  See [migration](FOS_MIGRATION.md) for the next gates.
