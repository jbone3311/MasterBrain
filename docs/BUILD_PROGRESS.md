# MasterBrain Build Progress

## Active checkpoint

**Checkpoint 3G — rebuild generation/execution contract.** Work occurs on
`codex/masterbrain-foundation` in PR #4. Design an additive generation that can replace
a corrupt derived index without mutating evidence or pretending an absent source is
current. No executor is authorized yet.

## Completed gates

- Foundation identity/architecture documentation and ADR-047.
- DC-001 read-only hash/dedupe extraction from pinned FOS-Master.
- Initial live-donor hash/name/both parity corpus.
- Hosted CI and synthetic PostgreSQL restore green at foundation baseline.
- Checkpoint 1 shared CLI, contracts, FileOS snapshots and 3,000-file donor parity
  completed in commit `73b58cb`; hosted CI and restore are green.
- Checkpoint 2 persistence/index completed in commits `20c5fb8` and `380761b`;
  hosted CI and populated logical restore are green.
- Checkpoint 3A text/Markdown/HTML/CSV extraction completed in `afebced`; hosted CI,
  donor parity and restore are green.
- Progressive Brain API read slice completed in `a06bcad`; hosted CI
  [35703242987](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35703242987)
  and restore
  [35703242983](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35703242983)
  are green.
- Final receipt revision `ee6b662` passed hosted CI and restore; it changes only
  measured documentation after the `a06bcad` runtime.
- Checkpoint 4 foundation revision `7d2afbf` passed hosted

- Checkpoint 3D whole-run completion/freshness runtime `1e0f87e` plus valid-conflict
  test correction `c12800f` passed hosted
  [CI 35716362139](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35716362139)

  [CI 35720358559](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35720358559)
  and [restore 35720358811](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35720358811).

## Current work

- Specify an additive index-generation identity, activation receipt and rollback rule.
- Separate derivation rebuild from source reprocessing and current/historical retrieval.
- Require preview-plan binding, idempotency, RLS, crash recovery and query parity before
  any generation can become active.

## Deferred by design

- Legacy Office, archives, images and OCR until separate format/fault gates exist.
- Automatic knowledge extraction, graph traversal and synthesis until reviewed
  known-answer evaluation exists.
- All file/mail effects and any FOS-Master cutover/retirement.

## Rule for updates

After each checkpoint, record exact commits, tests, donor baseline, CI/restore runs,
known limits, rollback and the next active checkpoint. Do not mark a later checkpoint
active while an earlier gate has unexplained failures.
