# MasterBrain Build Progress

## Active checkpoint

**Checkpoint 3C — enrolled incremental FileOS operation.** Work occurs on
`codex/masterbrain-foundation` in PR #4.

## Completed gates

- Foundation identity/architecture documentation and ADR-047.
- DC-001 read-only hash/dedupe extraction from pinned FOS-Master.
- Initial live-donor hash/name/both parity corpus.
- Hosted CI and synthetic PostgreSQL restore green at foundation baseline.
- Checkpoint 1 shared CLI, contracts, FileOS snapshots and 3,000-file donor parity
  completed in commit `73b58cb`; hosted CI and restore are green.
- Checkpoint 2 persistence/index completed in commits `20c5fb8` and `380761b`;
  hosted CI and populated logical restore are green.
- Checkpoint 3A text/Markdown/HTML/CSV extraction completed in `afebced`; hosted CI,
  donor parity and restore are green.
- Progressive Brain API read slice completed in `a06bcad`; hosted CI
  [35703242987](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35703242987)
  and restore
  [35703242983](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35703242983)
  are green.
- Final receipt revision `ee6b662` passed hosted CI and restore; it changes only
  measured documentation after the `a06bcad` runtime.
- Checkpoint 4 foundation revision `7d2afbf` passed hosted
  [CI 35706332421](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35706332421)
  and [restore 35706332264](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35706332264).
- Checkpoint 5 grouped retrieval revision `b60acd2` passed hosted
  [CI 35707895947](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35707895947)
  and [restore 35707895954](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35707895954).
- Checkpoint 3B isolated PDF/DOCX/XLSX revision `a6488c6` passed hosted
  [CI 35711403192](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35711403192)
  and [restore 35711403138](https://github.com/jbone3311/CW-EmailBrain/actions/runs/35711403138).

## Current work

- Narrow private-config operator command now validates and publishes an exact snapshot
  without granting source-write authority; hosted PostgreSQL gate is pending.
- Exact request replay and source drift are visible; durable whole-run completion
  receipts and automated scheduling remain the next operational step.
- Exercise text and isolated document paths together through the controller in hosted
  PostgreSQL/container gates.

## Deferred by design

- Legacy Office, archives, images and OCR until separate format/fault gates exist.
- Automatic knowledge extraction, graph traversal and synthesis until reviewed
  known-answer evaluation exists.
- All file/mail effects and any FOS-Master cutover/retirement.

## Rule for updates

After each checkpoint, record exact commits, tests, donor baseline, CI/restore runs,
known limits, rollback and the next active checkpoint. Do not mark a later checkpoint
active while an earlier gate has unexplained failures.
